# Face-Recognition-ML

My code for the 2017 CSC411 Machine Learning project on actor face classification using linear regression. The data was obtained from the [Facescrub dataset](http://vintage.winklerbros.net/facescrub.html). The full compiled code is in faces.py, and running this script with all face images saved to the specified folders will classify the images. The final report outlining the results of the linear classification can be viewed in Final Report.pdf. All other code is supplementary. An example of a vector of training parameters that was obtained during the classification is shown below:

Yields the following theta (weights matrix):
